\section{BLOCKLICENSE ADVANTAGE}

In contrast to Maker \& Exchange platforms, BlockLicense doesn't require a subscription fee by creators or buyers, it allows creators to set their own licensing and pricing options for their work and only charges a 2\%  fee on work sold. In the following sections we will have a look at the types of licenses supported by BlockLicense and the types of licensing scenarios supported. The main distinction is whether the license corresponds to an open source license that is free to use or a commercial one that requires a fee.

\subsection{Features}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{BlockLicense Ecosystem}: An ecosystem consisting of a web-based platform, eshop widgets, a desktop application, a browser extension and plugins for digital design software such as ones created by Adobe. A BlockLicense MobileApp  that provides the necessary tools for licensing time-sensitive content such as footage \& photos of newsworthy events is planned for a later stage.
\bigskip
\item \textit{Easy to use}: BlockLicense is designed to offer very simple, novice-oriented tooling throughout the Ecosystem. Licensing of digital files can be performed using the same tools creators use for their day-to-day work. Pricing determination is simplified by providing useful statistics such as average and best seller price of similar work.
\bigskip
\item \textit{License Manager}: An ecosystem wide license manager is provided for creators to easily manage and use their library of custom licenses.
\bigskip
\item \textit{Multiple Stakeholders}: Complex licensing scenarios are supported such as ones involving multiple stakeholders. Stakeholder percentages are specified during the process of attaching a license to a file. This creates a significant automation and simplifies otherwise complex financial activities that may occur when sharing capital between stakeholders.
\bigskip
\item \textit{Reselling}: Creators can expand their distribution network by allowing reselling of their files, while buyers can make a profit from work resold. The Ethereum smart contract code automatically calculates and forwards the appropriate funds to all parties involved. 
\bigskip
\item \textit{File Recovery}: Files can be recovered through distributed Web 3.0 services.
