\begin{abstract}
{\it BlockLicense is a decentralized ecosystem that enables fair licensing, pricing and distribution of creative content and aims to liberate creators from intermediates. BlockLicense has licensing, pricing and attribution at its very core by embedding relevant information to the backbone of digital files without altering their behavior. Transactions within BlockLicense take place through an ecosystem-specific coin, namely the License Coin (LCN) that is based on Ethereum and is compatible with smart contracts running on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Distributed file systems and databases are used for file storage and information retrieval. The BlockLicense ecosystem is a complete solution that provides plugins for popular design software, enabling creators to add licensing and pricing to their creative workflow, a desktop application, a browser extension, as well as a web-based platform where end-users can easily acquire a license for their required content. We believe that BlockLicense is a revolutionary project that can completely alter the way creative work is distributed and funded and can have a positive impact on both creators and buyers.}
